This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Markdown Previewer
This is a fun simple app that enables you to write HTML markup using plain text, similar to how readme files are written for GitHub repositories. Basically, you follow the examples of how to write html elements in plain text on the left side of the screen, and the output will render on the right hand side of the screen.
