This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Markdown Previewer
This is a fun simple app that enables you to write HTML markup using plain text, similar to how readme files are written for GitHub repositories. Basically, you follow the examples of how to write html elements in plain text on the left side of the screen, and the output will render on the right hand side of the screen.

To use the app, just open https://markdown-previewer-react-v.herokuapp.com/ in your browser.
(Or you can download this repo, navigate to the project folder using your terminal, and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then, just run `npm start` and enjoy!

Have fun! :)
